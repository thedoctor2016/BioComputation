# BioComputation
This is my GA project with Excel graphs and text print outs, the GAs are written in Python 3.6. <br />
The file GA is the GA that is configured for f = (X^2) <br />
The file GA_f_2 is the GA that is configured for the second function <br />
The file GA_f_3 is the real world GA and requires the numpy module to be installed
Excel files the X^2 ones are related to function 1 <br />
The F(X,Y) files are the fucntion 2 graphs <br />
Finally the excel files called Floating are the function 3 graphs releating to the fact the GA is now a string of floats/
